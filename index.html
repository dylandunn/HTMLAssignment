  <h1>The best type of dog</h1>
  <p>The best type of dog is a Boxer. No discussion. Not here to argue. Here are some reasons anyways:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Very entergetic and playful</li>
      <li>Great around children</li>
      <li>Adorable, but also can be mean looking if you know nothing about Boxers</li>
  </ul>
